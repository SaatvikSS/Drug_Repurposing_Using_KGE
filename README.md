# Drug_Repurposing_Using_KGE
Our Drug Repurposing platform leverages advanced knowledge graph technology to identify new therapeutic uses for existing drugs, accelerating the discovery process and reducing development costs. By integrating vast biomedical datasets, our platform maps complex relationships between diseases, genes, and approved medications, unveiling hidden connections that can lead to groundbreaking treatments.

Using the Gemini API, our platform enhances these knowledge graphs with cutting-edge natural language processing and machine learning capabilities. Gemini's powerful content generation and analysis features allow us to process and interpret scientific literature, clinical trial data, and biomedical databases at scale, automatically enriching the knowledge graph with the latest research insights. The API also enables dynamic visualisation and exploration of these relationships, making it easier for researchers and pharmaceutical companies to uncover actionable drug repurposing opportunities.
